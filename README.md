# Spam-Classifier

-First You have To download the whole project and put it in your Desktop 

-Open Anaconda and then launch Jupyter Notebook either by clicking on Launch or you can type the command in cmd "jupyter notebook"

-open cmd to install some dependecies for the project 

-run this command 'pip install -U scikit-learn'

-another dependency you'll need is the data set we are going to use to train our machine learning model
hop to 'https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/treccorpus07/' and download the 255mb file and put it in same folder as this project that you downloaded

once installed you can open the files 'spam-iterative'  and  'spam-Machine-Learning'.

you can run the code by pressing "cells" in the top of the file and "run cells"

you'll see the difference in the accuracy between the two models the one with iterative approach and the other 
that uses MultinomialNB model for predictions.

approach me if you have any questions , we will complete this project by exporting the trained model and use it to 
block emails in a simple web flask app.
